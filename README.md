### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Abdirasul, an aspiring software developer from Karakalpakstan.

## About me

I'm currently learning to code and working towards becoming a software developer. I'm passionate about technology and love the challenge of learning something new.

Right now, I'm focusing on learning React and building my first web applications. I'm using resources like [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) and [React JS documentation](https://react.dev/) to learn.

## My projects

- [Movie App](https://github.com/uabdirasul/movieapp): I built it while I was learning about React Props.
- [Crappo Landing Page](https://github.com/uabdirasul/Crappo): I tried to show my skills about creating landing pages with HTML and CSS.
- ... soon some projects:)

## My goals

In the future, I hope to build more complex web applications and contribute to open source projects. I'm excited to continue learning and growing as a software developer!
